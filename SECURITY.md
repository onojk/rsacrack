# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This project is a research and visualization experiment.  
It is **not** designed to attack, weaken, or compromise real-world cryptographic systems.

## Responsible Use
- All experiments should be done only with **toy semiprimes** (small numbers such as 32â€“64 bits).  
- **Do not attempt** to use this project on real RSA keys or sensitive data.  
- Results from this repository should be considered **educational** and **illustrative only**.

## Disclaimer
RSA with key sizes of 2048 bits and above remains secure against the methods in this repository.  
The techniques here (Pollard's Rho, prime coil visualization) are classical and well-known in mathematics and number theory.  

This project is intended for:
- Educational demonstrations  
- Mathematical visualization of primes and factorization  
- Research into novel geometric representations of numbers  

**This project does not provide any practical means of breaking modern cryptography.**

## Reporting Issues
If you notice any misuse of this repository (e.g., someone attempting to promote it as a real "RSA cracker"), please open an issue or contact the repository maintainer.
