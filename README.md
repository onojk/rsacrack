RSAcrack

RSAcrack: Exploring a conical spring (coil) model of numbers and primes to visualize overlaps, factorization, and potential cryptographic implications.

ðŸ“– Overview

This project models natural numbers along a conical coil.

A full coil contains all integers.

A prime coil overlays the prime numbers only.

At each prime, the two coils touch tangentially, forming intersection points.

Composite numbers can be interpreted as inheriting structure from the primes beneath them on the coil.

ðŸ‘‰ The goal: explore whether these geometric overlaps reveal shortcuts to prime factorization.

ðŸš€ Features

3D coil model of natural numbers

## ðŸ”’ Security & Ethical Disclaimer

This project is **purely educational and experimental**.  
It explores toy factorization methods, geometric models of numbers, and visualizations of primes.  

- The code only targets **small, synthetic semiprimes** (e.g., 32â€“64 bits) that are generated for testing.  
- It is **not capable of factoring real cryptographic keys** (RSA keys used in practice are 2048 bits or larger).  
- The purpose is to **study mathematical patterns and algorithm behavior**, not to attack real-world security systems.  
- Please use responsibly: attempting to crack real encryption without permission is illegal and unethical.
