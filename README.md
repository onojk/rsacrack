RSAcrack: Exploring a conical spring (coil) model of numbers and primes to visualize overlaps, factorization, and potential cryptographic implications.

ðŸ“– Overview

This project models natural numbers along a conical coil.

A full coil contains all integers.

A prime coil overlays the prime numbers only.

At each prime, the two coils touch tangentially, forming intersection points.

Composite numbers can be interpreted as inheriting structure from the primes beneath them on the coil.

ðŸ‘‰ The goal: explore whether these geometric overlaps reveal shortcuts to prime factorization.
