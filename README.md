# RSAcrack

RSAcrack: Exploring a conical spring (coil) model of numbers and primes to visualize overlaps, factorization, and potential cryptographic implications.

## Overview
This project models numbers along a conical coil, with primes forming a tangent coil that intersects at prime positions.  
Composite numbers inherit structure from prime overlaps beneath their location.  
The goal is to study whether these geometric relationships reveal shortcuts to **prime factorization**.

## Features
- 3D coil model of natural numbers
- Overlay of prime coil vs. full coil
- Visualization of tangent points (prime positions)
- Experimental factorization methods
- Whitepaper included

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/rsacrack.git
cd rsacrack
pip install -r requirements.txt
python coil_model.py

Status

Coil equation formalized

Visualizations of primes vs. all numbers

Factorization prototype

    Benchmark against RSA key sizes

Disclaimer

This project is experimental research.
It is not a proven method for breaking RSA cryptography â€” use responsibly.
